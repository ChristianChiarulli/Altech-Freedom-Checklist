# Altech Freedom Checklist

I am tracking my progress towards freedom here

## Cloud (Alternative Google Drive, DropBox)
- Nextcloud (ownyourbits nextcloudpi is the best for this)

## Web Browsers (Alternative to Chrome, Firefox)

- Brave (This is the worst browser you should even consider)
- Librewolf (Coming from Firefox) 
- Ungoogled-Chromium (Coming from Chrome)

## Search Engines

- Searx
- Startpage
- DuckDuckGo (Idk if I trust these guys)
- Brave has a new private search you can sign up for

## Messaging

- Telegram (Absolute worst you should be using) 
- Signal (Needs a phone number, not ideal)
- Matrix (Chad chat app, no need for number or email)
- Session (Also Chad but a bit newer)
- Brier (All on device, can be used with no net access)  

## Music
- Plex (This is the worst you should even consider)
- Jellyfin (Really for video, but can do music too)

## VPS (Alternative to AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Vultr
- Linode

## Password Manager

- MyKi (Interesting because no cloud, not sure if free tho)
- Bitwarden (Best with your own server)

## Phone (Alternative to iPhone, and other Android Phones)

## Laptop

Ideally Libreboot

- Old Thinkpad (X220 and X220 Tablet is the best)
- System76 (core booted versions)

## Money (Alternative to the Dollar and other Fiat currencies)
