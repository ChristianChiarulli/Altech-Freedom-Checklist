# Altech Freedom Checklist

I am tracking my progress towards freedom here

## Web Browsers (Alternative to Chrome, Firefox)

- Brave (This is the worst browser you should even consider)
- Librewolf (Coming from Firefox) 
- Ungoogled-Chromium (Coming from Chrome)

## Search Engines

- Searx
- Startpage
- DuckDuckGo (Idk if I trust these guys)
- Brave has a new private search you can sign up for

## Messaging

- Telegram (Absolute worst you should be using) 
- Signal (Needs a phone number, not ideal)
- Matrix (Chad chat app, no need for number or email)
- Session (Also Chad but a bit newer)

## Music

Will probably need to set up a server of some sort

## VPS (Alternative to AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)

I hear Vultr is good

## Password Manager

- MyKi (Interesting because no cloud, not sure if free tho)
- Bitwarden (Best with your own server)
- KeePass (or derivative e.g., KeePassXC)

## Phone (Alternative to iPhone, and other Android Phones)

- Graphene OS (This is the worst phone OS you should consider, can only load on Pixel(yuck))
- Pinephone (Not powerful enough yet)
- Librem5 (Not powerful enough yet, and is a absolute unit)

## Laptop

Must at bare minimum be coreboot
Ideally Libreboot

- Old Thinkpad (If you're a boomer)
- System76 (core booted versions)
- Purism (why is the shift key on the right so small)
- PinebookPro (Best cheap laptop I've seen)

## Video/Streaming Platforms

- Odysee
- Theta
- PeerTube
- LivePeer

## Money (Alternative to the Dollar and other Fiat currencies)

- Bitcoin
- Monero
- Ethereum
- Cardano
- USDC and other stable coins (Send dollars over crypto)

## Savings accounts

- BlockFi
- Celsius
- Voyager

### Decentralized Finance
