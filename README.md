# Altech Freedom Checklist

I am tracking my progress towards freedom here

## Cloud (Alternative Google Drive, DropBox)
- Nextcloud (ownyourbits nextcloudpi is the best for this)

## Web Browsers (Alternative to Chrome, Firefox)

- Brave (This is the worst browser you should even consider)
- Librewolf (Coming from Firefox) 
- Ungoogled-Chromium (Coming from Chrome)

## Search Engines

- Searx
- Startpage
- DuckDuckGo (Idk if I trust these guys)
- Brave has a new private search you can sign up for

## Messaging

- Telegram (Absolute worst you should be using) 
- Signal (Needs a phone number, not ideal)
- Matrix (Chad chat app, no need for number or email)
- Session (Also Chad but a bit newer)
- Brier (All on device, can be used with no net access)
- Nextcloud Talk (nextcloudpi works great for this)


## Music
- Plex (This is the worst you should even consider)
- Jellyfin (Really for video, but can do music too)

## VPS (Alternative to AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Vultr
- Linode

## Password Manager

- MyKi (Interesting because no cloud, not sure if free tho)
- Bitwarden (Best with your own server)
- KeePass (or derivative e.g., KeePassXC)
- Keepassxc (This is the best, save password file to a thumbdrive)
- Pass (unix standard password manager, even better than keepass)

## Phone (Alternative to iPhone, and other Android Phones)

- Graphene OS (This is the worst phone OS you should consider, can only load on Pixel)
- Pinephone (Not powerful enough yet)
- Librem5 (Not powerful enough yet, and is a absolute unit)
- /e/OS (Ungoogled OS has good support for a lot of Operating Systems)
- ubuntu touch (Full ubuntu distro for phone)

## Laptop

Must at bare minimum be coreboot
Ideally Libreboot

- Old Thinkpad (X220 and X220 Tablet is the best)
- System76 (core booted versions)

- Chromebook (Coreboot with mrchromebox and you get a rugged laptop for $60)

## Video/Streaming Platforms

- Bitchute (chringe but good idea)

## Money (Alternative to the Dollar and other Fiat currencies)

- Bitcoin
- Lighting (built on Bitcoin but usable like cash)
- Monero
- Ethereum
- Cardano
- USDC and other stable coins (Send dollars over crypto)

## Node (self host)
- RaspiBlitz (Lighting node on Pi)
- Umbrel (Lighting node on Pi marketed to be easy for anyone)

## Savings accounts

## Proprietary but better than bank returns with stablecoins

- BlockFi
- Celsius
- Voyager

## Decentralized Finance
